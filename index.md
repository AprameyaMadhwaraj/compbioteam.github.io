## About Us
Our research is in computational biology, bioinformatics, and health informatics. We focus on developing algorithmic and mathematical solutions addressing challenging problems in these areas that benefit society at large. Developed solutions are implemented as computer programs, tested, and fine-tuned in the field through tight collaborations with partners from various applied research institutions. Our active research includes
1. phylogenetic network inference,
2. phylogenic diversity,
3. comparative phylogenetics,
4. medical image recognition and analysis,
5. rapid taxonomic sequence classification 
6. read mapping
7. primer design
8. E3 ligase substrate interaction predictions.
